meta-measured
-------------
This layer's purpose is constructing a linux system that performs a 'measured launch'. This requires enabling support for:
- the TPM and Intel TXT (kernel config / module)
- the TCG Software Stack (through TrouSerS)
- tboot and Authenticated Code Modules (ACMs)

Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on the openembedded metadata and bitbake.

Maintenance
-----------
Please see the MAINTAINERS file for information on contacting the maintainers
of this layer, as well as instructions for submitting patches.

Building the meta-measured layer
-------------------------------
Enable this layer like you enable any other layer.  If you wish to build the
reference images you can clone the 'oe-build-scripts' repo from my github and
checkout the 'measured' branch to get my scripts that set up bitbake and the
basic OE metadata for you.
